Mini Voting System
The system stores the information about the voters like their voter IDs, names and details. -> Allows us to set up a flexible and trustworthy voting system -> Applicable for large as well as small group of people e.g. a batch, a class. -> Keeps a record of every voting process.

SWOT Analysis:

STRENGTHS: 1.Use of different coding functions like structures, recursions, type definitions, pointers etc. 2.Use of header files for to search for built in fuctions and header files for searching a particular directory to use manually made functions. 3.Use of multi-file programming in C and functions of various files used in the main program to execute the code through function calls.

WEAKNESSES: 1.The program is not able to run if correct input is not provided. 2.The program will not be able to run for longer input and will show "out of bounds" error.

OPPORTUNITIES: 1.By little modifications program code could be utilized in real life applications like identity verification, data storage etc. 2.It can be used in local MSMBs shops for various purposes.

THREATS: 1.code written in simple C language could be hacked through third parties easliy. 2.The user has to delete the whole data of one input if entered incorrectly.
